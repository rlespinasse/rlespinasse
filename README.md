### Personal projects

In term of automation, I play with **Github Actions**

- to `slug` some environment variables : [Github Slug Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-slug),
- to expose some git commit data : [Git Commit Data Action](https://github.com/rlespinasse/git-commit-data-action),
- to add track capabilities between issues : [Issues Tracker Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/issues-tracker).

And also

- [drawio-export](https://github.com/rlespinasse/drawio-export) : Export Draw.io diagrams using command line / docker,
- [drawio-cli](https://github.com/rlespinasse/drawio-cli) : CLI for Draw.io.

In the `golang` world,

- [hoff](https://github.com/rlespinasse/hoff) serve as an engine to run workflows composed of high order functions,
- You can manipulate some bytes with [byteslice](https://github.com/rlespinasse/byteslice).

Because I love to play with `bash` scripts, [michel](https://github.com/rlespinasse/michel) help to structure all yours scripts.
> Try **michel** who serve as GitHub template.
